    <h1>Eli's Coding Journey</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Elijah Hoffman and i am an aspiring web developer. I want to make <strong>cool</strong> things with code. I have some cool projects under my belt. The biggest project I made so far is either my fantasy fighting game in c++, or my online marketplace/shop in Java. Both of these were school projects. On the side, I made a web app called 'What happened today?' which displays the current time and an interesting fact that happend that day. The problem with these projects is that I can't really credit myself with creating them. The fantasy fighting game is pretty rough around the edges and is more of a press enter simulator than a game. For the java project, I copied code from my classwork and pasted it in the weekly homework. I truly had no idea about the concepts of it all and rushed it to get it done and get a solid grade. Finally, the web app is a modified tutorial on making a clock. The clock is ripped straight from the tutorial, and although I did use an API and added some things to the tutorial and changed some things around, it really is not mine. It wasn't until I started working on another project 'NBA guessing game' in which I found out that I really cannot create anything from the ground up. I feel as though I got stuck in the loop of comparing myself to others and wanting to create <strong>cool</strong> things I glossed over the fact that I have to make <strong>things</strong>. I purchased codecademy a while ago, and would rush through the lesson plans to see the progress bar go up, instead of trying to understand the concepts. So, I have humbled myself into restarting my progress on codecademy and am going to document this slow journey to help myself stay motivated and hopefully land a job.</p>

      <h3><em>April 3, 2023</em></h3>
      <p>This is the first day of something great. I started codecademy over again, and completed the 
        Introduction to HTML section and the first quiz. Most of this was review, but some stuff blew my mind. For example. I had no idea that things inside the <strong> <body> </strong> tag are the only things shown on a webpage. It seems trival now, and looking back on my projects I saw that the only things displayed on the page <em>were</em> inside of the <strong> <body> </strong> tag. I used the <strong> <span> </strong> tag before but had no idea on what it's use was. It can be used to separate small pieces of text that are on the same line as other content.For example, if you wanted to write about self driving cars you could split up the elements like this.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>< p >< span ><strong>Self driving cars</strong> < /span > are cars that drive by themselves</em>< /p >
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, I learned about styling text <em>within</em> html, and not using css to do all the work there.<em>< em ></em> itallicies text, and <strong> < strong > </strong> bolds text. Finally the last couple things learned were revolving around the < img > and < video > tags. I found that the <em>alt</em> attribute which is displayed if the img is not supported helps with visually impaired people that might be on the website, as well as SEO, which I recently learned about because I applied for an internship that has a basic knowledge of SEO as a requirement. That interview is in 3 days, so hopefully I do good. Additionally, text inside the opening and closing tags of the < video > attribute is pretty much what the alt attribute is in the video tag.
            <br>
            All in all, I'm excited to re start my coding journey and build a strong foundation to create amazing things and land an amazing job.

        <h3><em>April 4, 2023</em></h3>
        <p>This is the second day on my web development journey. Today, I learned all about the          
          <em>< a ></em>
        tag. Its a big foundation of HTML, as its a hyper link and hyper is the first word in HyperTextMarkupLanguage which is a new thing sweeping the nation that I'd love to give a try sometime. 
          <br>
        The
          <em> < a > </em>
        tag can be used to link to different websites, like my 
          <a href = "https://ehof17.github.io/What-Happened-Today/" target = "_blank">What Happened Today?</a>
        app, or to places on the current site like
          <a href = "#dayone">Day One</a>
        .Additonally, text isn't the only thing that can be used as a link, as one can wrap a 
          <em> < img > </em>
        tag around an
          <em> < a > tag </em>
        like so
          <br>
          <em> < a href = panda.wikepedia > < img src = "panda.jpg" >< /a ></em>
          <br>
        can produce a result like this:
          <br>
          <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda"target = "_blank">
            <img src = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525382455947-f319bc05fb35?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1796&q=80" height = "292" width = "300" alt = "A big giant panda">
          </a>
          <br>
        It's important to note that by setting the 
          <strong>target</strong>
        attribute in an 
          <em> < a > </a>
          </em>        
        tag to "_blank" the link opens up in a new tab as opposed to opening the link on the current tab.
          <br>
        The final part of today's lesson was about readability, which can be improved with comments, which are written with this format
          <br>
          <em>
            < !--Comment Here-- >
          </em>
          <br>
          and conventions like starting every new tag with a new line and putting two spaces between child tags.
